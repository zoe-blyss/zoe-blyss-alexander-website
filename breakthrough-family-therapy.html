    <h2>The Project</h2>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">For this freelancing assignment, my client wanted a new website, business cards, and brochures designed for her Marriage and Family Therapy practice. My task was to create her company's branding and use it to design the website, business cards, and brochures, as well as code the website itself.</p>

    <h2>"Like an Orchid"</h2>
    <p>After creating an preliminary template of the website using copy provided by the client, she and I had a meeting together and discussed the overall aesthetic she desired for the site.</p>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">My client stated that she wanted two elements in particular for her website: a friendly font, and for the color palette to be “like an orchid.” To further understand what she meant by this, we conducted some research together and she picked out a photo from which she wanted me to base the color palette, text, and imagery of the website:</p>
    <img src="images/breakthrough-family-therapy-background.jpg" alt="image of an orchid" class="p--end-spacing-large">
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">The results of the font, photo, and color scheme chosen are encapsulated in the style guide I created below:</p>
    <img src="images/breakthrough-family-therapy-style-guide.png" alt="image of the style guide" class="p--end-spacing-large">

    <h2>Website - Responsive Design</h2>
    <p>According to DMR Business Statistics<a href="https://expandedramblings.com/index.php/smartphone-statistics/" target="_blank">*</a>, 58% of all US internet searches come from a mobile device. With this is mind, it was essential to create a website that was responsive – meaning the site was easily viewable on any screen dimension.</p>
    <p>Since I had already created a basic responsive template/wireframe and a style guide for the site, I did not create a mock-up but instead started to code the website directly using the colors and font chosen by my client and me.</p>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">To ensure the website fit the responsive design guidelines, I continuously used the “inspect” developer tool in a the Chrome web browser and tested my code in the “responsive” formatting to ensure that it was readable at any screen width beyond 300 pixels (the iPhone 5/SE has the smallest screen width of any commonly used digital device at 320 pixels). I also tested the screen on several phones as well as computers to further ensure that the text was legible and links were easily navigable at any size.</p>

    <h2>Business Cards</h2>
    <p>Wanting to create a cohesive brand for her business, I decided to continue to use elements from the style guide while creating her business cards. This was so that when a customer that first picked up a business card and then used the information on the card to access the website, the customer would know that they were on the correct website because the style and imagery of both matched.</p>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">To create the business cards, we decided what information she would want on the card when handing them out to people or leaving them in medical offices, and then incorporated the style guide imagery and font into the design.</p>

    <h2>Brochures</h2>
    <p>When creating the brochures, my client provided me the copy she wanted to me include and told me that she wanted the brochure to be 2-sided. It was my task to determine where to effectively place each part of information, which side it should be on, and to keep the overall design in-line with the brand.</p>
    <p>My first task was to create a wireframe of the brochure. When thinking about the information and text placement, I determined that the name of the company, the question “Has illness affected your family?”,  and the description what therapy is were the most important to have on the front of the brochure because they would give the observer an overall understanding of what the card was about (promotional material for therapy) as well as show that this therapy practice focuses on helping people struggling with family illness-related stress in particular.</p>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">I decided to list the contact information and specialized areas of focus sections on the back as people who have picked up the brochure have already shown primary interest in the service and would only then be looking for additional information as well as how to reach the business.</p>

    <img src="images/bft-rack-card-template--back.jpg" alt="image of the back of the bft rack card template" class="p--end-spacing-large">
    <p>After sending the wireframes to the client and having them approved, my next task was to create a full mock-up using the elements from the branding style guide.</p>
    <p>I played around with several designs, but then decided to keep the brochures similar to the website by having the orchid in the background, placing green accents on the top and bottom of the card, and using the same font as it keeps the information on the card easy-to-read.</p>
    <p>The trickiest part was determining whether to emphasize the text “Breakthrough Family Therapy” or “Has illness affected your family?” in the design, and how to do so without making the cards look tacky. I decided to highlight the latter, as the question emphasizes the main pain point of a potential customer right away and make them more likely to be curious about the product.  The name of the business, although important, does not state in its title that it specializes in illness-related therapy and is thus secondary information.</p>
    <p class="p--end-spacing-large">Since the overall design of the brand contains muted colors, I decided to use a gray-to-green gradient box around the pain-point question as I wanted to emphasize it. This way it was still on-brand with the rest of the color scheme but provides enough variation from the rest of the brochure that it draws the eyes there first.</p>
